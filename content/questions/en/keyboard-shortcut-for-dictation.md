<p>In today's fast-paced work environment, we're constantly looking for ways to become more efficient. Dictating text instead of typing can be a real game-changer here. But which keyboard shortcut actually starts the dictation function? And what if you already have an audio recording that you want to convert to text? This article provides you with the answers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dictating Directly in the Operating System: The Standard Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Many modern operating systems offer built-in dictation features that you can activate with a simple keyboard shortcut. This is particularly convenient for quick notes, emails, or short text entries directly in applications.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dictating on Windows</h3>

<p>On most Windows systems (Windows 10 and newer), you start the dictation function with the following keyboard shortcut:</p>

<p><strong><code>Windows key + H</code></strong></p>

<p>After pressing these keys, a small dictation bar appears. Simply speak into your microphone, and Windows converts your speech to text, which is inserted at the current cursor position.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for Windows Dictation:</strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Make sure your microphone is correctly set up and selected.</li>



<li>Speak clearly and at a normal pace.</li>



<li>You can also dictate punctuation (e.g., "comma", "period", "new line").</li>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dictating on macOS</h3>

<p>macOS also has a powerful built-in dictation feature. By default, you often activate it by:</p>

<p><strong>Double-pressing the <code>Fn</code> key (function key)</strong></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can set a different keyboard shortcut or activate the function in System Preferences under "Keyboard" > "Dictation". A microphone icon signals that macOS is listening.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for macOS Dictation:</strong></p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Check the dictation settings for language and keyboard shortcut.</li>



<li>macOS learns to recognize your voice better over time, increasing accuracy.</li>



<li>Here too, you can dictate punctuation and formatting commands.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Limitations of Built-in Dictation Functions</h2>

<p>While native dictation functions are very useful, they reach their limits with certain requirements:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> With complex technical terms, strong dialects, or background noise, accuracy can suffer.</li>



<li><strong>Processing audio recordings:</strong> The built-in functions are primarily designed for live input, not for transcribing existing audio files (e.g., interviews, long dictations, lecture recordings).</li>



<li><strong>Data privacy:</strong> With very sensitive data, you might want to know exactly where and how your voice data is being processed.</li>
