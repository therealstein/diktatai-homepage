<p>Microsoft Excel is a powerful tool for data analysis, reporting, and organization. However, manual data entry, especially with large amounts or complex datasets, can be time-consuming and tiring. Many users therefore ask: Can't I just dictate my Excel tables using voice?</p>

<p>While Excel itself (depending on the version and add-ins) only offers limited native dictation functions for content and doesn't understand complex voice commands, <strong>Diktat AI opens up a clever and efficient way to prepare your data with voice for Excel and transfer it lightning fast.</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Challenge: Direct Voice Control vs. Efficient Data Entry</h2>

<p>It's important to understand: Diktat AI is not a tool that directly controls Excel, for example to say "Format cell B5 bold" or "Create a new worksheet". The genius approach of Diktat AI lies in its core competency: <strong>highly precise and fast transcription from speech to text.</strong> And that's exactly what you can use to massively accelerate your Excel work.</p>

<p>Imagine you have lists of inventory, contact data, survey results, or notes that need to be transferred to an Excel table. Instead of laboriously typing everything, you simply dictate it!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to Use Diktat AI for Your Excel Data: The Workflow</h2>

<p>The process is incredibly simple and integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows:</p>

<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Dictate data:</strong> Speak the data you want to capture in Excel clearly and distinctly into your recording device (smartphone, dictation device, PC microphone).
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Tip for structured data:</strong> To make later assignment to columns easier, you can dictate the data row by row and use separator words like "next column", "tab" or a specific keyword that you can easily replace later. Example: "Item number 123 <em>comma</em> Product name SuperWidget <em>comma</em> Price 19 euros 99 <em>comma</em> Stock 50 pieces <em>Next row</em> Item number 456..."</li>



<li>Alternatively, you can simply dictate lists that are then assigned to each column.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Upload audio recording:</strong> Upload the audio file to the Diktat AI platform. This is quick via drag & drop or using the upload button. The "Simply transcribe by email" function can also be worth its weight in gold here - send the audio file to your Diktat AI email address, done.</li>



<li><strong>AI does the work:</strong> Our advanced AI analyzes your recording and converts the spoken words into precise text. Thanks to GDPR compliance and servers in the EU, your data always remains secure.</li>



<li><strong>Receive and prepare transcript:</strong> You receive the transcript in your Diktat AI account. Now you can quickly review and adjust it if necessary:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you used separator words (e.g., "<em>comma</em>"), you can now replace them with actual tab characters or commas (for CSV import). Many text editors offer a "Find and Replace" function.</li>



<li>Make sure each line in the text corresponds to a row in your future Excel table.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Insert data into Excel:</strong>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Copy & Paste:</strong> Select the prepared text and paste it directly into your Excel table. If you used tab characters as separators, Excel will often automatically distribute the data correctly into the columns.</li>



<li><strong>Import from text (for CSV-like data):</strong> If your text is separated by commas or other characters, you can use the function "Data" > "Get Data from Text/CSV" in Excel. Excel will then guide you through a wizard to import the data correctly and assign it to columns.</li>
