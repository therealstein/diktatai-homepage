<p>Your Samsung smartphone or tablet can do more than just display text – it can also read it aloud to you! The so-called Text-to-Speech (TTS) function is a powerful tool that not only improves accessibility but can also be practical in everyday life, for example, to have messages, emails, or e-books read aloud while on the go. Here you'll learn how to set up and use Samsung Text-to-Speech.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Text-to-Speech (TTS) anyway?</h2>

<p>Text-to-Speech is a technology that converts written text into spoken language. Your device reads digital texts aloud with a computer-generated voice. Samsung devices offer their own solutions for this as well as the ability to use Google's TTS engine.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Activating and Setting Up Samsung Text-to-Speech – Step-by-Step</h2>

<p>You'll find the settings for Text-to-Speech in your Samsung device's system settings. The exact path may vary slightly depending on the Android version and One UI interface, but is fundamentally similar:</p>

<li><strong>Navigate to "General management":</strong> Scroll down a bit and select this menu item.</li>
